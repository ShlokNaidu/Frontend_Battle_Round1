My main motive was to make a aesthetic looking webpage consisting of as many animations as i could add without hindering the flow of the app
I used vercel v0 to help me build this.
To use this locally , you just need to copy paste the code in the files , no extra packages need to be installed as i decide to keep it simple and use no frameworks.
